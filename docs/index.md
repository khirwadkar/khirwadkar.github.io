# Welcome to Sanjay Khirwadkar's Portfolio

## **Introduction**

I have been in the business of human resource development for the last 35+ years. I carry out this
mission by way of educating and training (human) students in the field of programming languages 
and some engineering subjects. To facilitate and enrich this process, I have developed 
several tools in the form of software projects, technical papers, and videos.
What follows is the showcase of some of this work.

## **Open-source Projects**

I am currently working on a structural engineering software called **StructInsight**.
The details about this software and it's source code is available at:
 [https://github.com/khirwadkar/StructInsight_in_Python](https://github.com/khirwadkar/StructInsight_in_Python)

I have developed this software as a Python package and published it on the *PyPI* repository. So, it can be easily
installed using *pip*. See the *PyPI* details at: [https://pypi.org/project/continuousbeam/](https://pypi.org/project/continuousbeam/)

Before developing the *Python* version of this software, I had developed it in *Java* programming language.
The source code for the same is available at:
 [https://github.com/khirwadkar/StructInsight](https://github.com/khirwadkar/StructInsight)


## **Publications**

 - “Stochastic programming of concrete poles” (authors- R. Ranganathan and Sanjay G. Khirwadkar); published in
   'International Journal of Structures', Vol. 4, No. 3, July 1984.
   Link to: [Photocopy of the paper.](assets/paper-1-Reliability.pdf)

 - “Integrative model of CAD software in steel design” (author- Sanjay G. Khirwadkar); published in the proceedings
   of 'All India Seminar on Modern Trends in Steel Structures', February 2002.
   Link to: [Photocopy of the paper.](assets/paper-2-Steel-Structures.pdf)

 - A monograph on Vedic Mathematics based on my experience of conducting several bootcamps and workshops on the
   subject. View it here: [Applied Vedic Mathematics.](https://gist.github.com/khirwadkar/4d36abcf260d4189d3eb01a3f0a12d84)

 - In 2002-2003, I wrote a series of articles to popularize Science, in Marathi language, in the newspaper 'Loksatta'. 
   These were published on a weekly basis for about six months. This series received first prize in a competition conducted by
   *Marathi Vidyan Parishad* (Marathi Science Movement) in 2003-2004. Links to photocopies of some of these articles
   are given below.

## **YouTube Videos**
At my institute, it was compulsory for students to do a capstone project at the end of their respective
programming course. I used to guide them in selecting the topic of their project and it's scope. To 
increase their confidence, I also used to demonstrate the projects carried out by the students of 
the previous cohorts. Two of such demonstrations are available at the following links.

 - C++ project on autonomous car path search: [https://youtu.be/y4jpuHVi6JA](https://youtu.be/y4jpuHVi6JA)

 - C++ project for interior decorators: [https://youtu.be/4waxkW7wPdQ](https://youtu.be/4waxkW7wPdQ)

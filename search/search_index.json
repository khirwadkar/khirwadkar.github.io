The details about this software and it's source code is available at:  https://github.com/khirwadkar/StructInsight_in_Python</p> <p>I have developed this software as a Python package and published it on the PyPI repository. So, it can be easily installed using pip. See the PyPI details at: https://pypi.org/project/continuousbeam/</p> <p>The following picture is a snapshot taken during the analysis of a structure using this software.</p> <p></p> <p>Before developing the Python version of this software, I had developed it in Java programming language. The source code for the same is available at:  https://github.com/khirwadkar/StructInsight</p>"},{"location":"#graphics-library-for-c-programming-course","title":"Graphics Library for C++ Programming Course","text":"<p>\"A picture is worth a thousand words,\" goes the adage! Being educated as a civil/structural engineer, expressing my ideas in the form of engineering graphics comes naturally to me.  I also like my students to be conversant with graphics programming. However, while conducting the initial cohorts of training courses for C++ three decades ago,  I experienced a serious lacuna in C++: it does not have a standard graphics library. Also, programming using third-party graphics libraries like Qt or GTK required  the graphics input and response to be handled in an asynchronous way. I quickly realized that the students found it very difficult  to grasp both the principles of programming and the asynchronous way of handling graphics in a single course of one trimester duration.  To overcome this obstacle, I developed my own custom graphics library that abstracted away this underlying asynchronous mechanism and  made the process of creating graphics as easy as issuing several function calls. This library empowered my students to quickly produce  impressive graphics-based projects. To learn more about this library and explore its capabilities, please visit the following link.</p> <p>Link to: Student Manual for kiteLib Graphics Library </p> <p>Some of these projects made by students under my guidance are available on DockerHub. Please see them in action by downloading the repo from the following link and executing it using Docker.</p> <p>Sample C++ Projects</p>"},{"location":"#publications","title":"Publications","text":"<ul> <li> <p>\u201cStochastic programming of concrete poles\u201d (authors- R.

I carry out this mission by way of educating and training (human) students in the field of programming languages  and some engineering subjects. To facilitate and enrich this process, I have developed  several tools in the form of software projects, technical papers, and videos. What follows is the showcase of some of this work.</p>"},{"location":"#open-source-projects","title":"Open-source Projects","text":"<p>I am currently working on a structural engineering software called StructInsight. The details about this software and it's source code is available at:  https://github.com/khirwadkar/StructInsight_in_Python</p> <p>I have developed this software as a Python package and published it on the PyPI repository. So, it can be easily installed using pip. See the PyPI details at: https://pypi.org/project/continuousbeam/</p> <p>Before developing the Python version of this software, I had developed it in Java programming language. The source code for the same is available at:  https://github.com/khirwadkar/StructInsight</p>"},{"location":"#publications","title":"Publications","text":"<ul> <li> <p>\u201cStochastic programming of concrete poles\u201d (authors- R.

I used to guide them in selecting the topic of their project and it's scope. To  increase their confidence, I also used to demonstrate the projects carried out by the students of  the previous cohorts. Two of such demonstrations are available at the following links.</p> <ul> <li> <p>C++ project on autonomous car path search: https://youtu.be/y4jpuHVi6JA</p> </li> <li> <p>C++ project for interior decorators: https://youtu.be/4waxkW7wPdQ</p> </li> </ul>"}]}
